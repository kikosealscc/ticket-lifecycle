Intake:  This is where a ticket is created. Users can submit tickets through various channels like the web portal, email, or API. Once a ticket is created, itâ€™s automatically logged into the system and assigned a unique ID for tracking.

Assignment and Communication:   After a ticket is created, it needs to be assigned to the appropriate agent or team responsible for handling it. Proper assignment ensures accountability and helps streamline the resolution process.
